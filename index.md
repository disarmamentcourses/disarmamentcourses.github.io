This website is intended to support and expand courses on nuclear disarmament
with a considerable science component, aimed mainly at STEM students.
We want to systematically collect information about existing courses and make
it available to other lecturers who may be interested in taking up such
teaching.
On this website, you can find syllabi of past courses, kindly provided by the
respective lecturers.
Please contact the lecturer(s) for more information on a
specific course.
This list will be expanded.

If you are interested in courses that focus on a political science approach,
see, e.g., the teaching resources offered by the [EU Non-Proliferation and
Disarmament
Consortium](https://www.nonproliferation.eu/education-resources/teaching-resources/).
